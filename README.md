Rover
=====

This is my solutions in multiple languages for the classic Rover modelization exercise used for interviews.

Java
----

Dependencies are:
  - Maven to build
  - TestNG for Tests (way better than JUnit, especially for Data Factory)

Branch Java 1.5 makes an heavy use of Java Enumerations. 
Branch Java 1.8 is an upgrade with streams and lambdas.

Ruby
----

Use of switch/case to be lightweight. Other modelization would be to do class hierarchy for Instruments.
Use array index manipulation for heading instead of radian calculation.

Javascript
----

With nodes.js

TODO.

Go
----

TODO.
