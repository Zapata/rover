Rover
=====

This is my solution for the classic Rover modelization exercise used for interviews.

Dependencies are:
  - Maven to build
  - TestNG for Tests (way better than JUnit, especially for Data Factory)

Branch Java 1.5 makes an heavy use of Java Enumerations. 
Branch Java 1.8 is an upgrade with streams and lambdas.
